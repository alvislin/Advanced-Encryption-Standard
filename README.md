# Advanced-Encryption-Standard

#Description
Hardware Implementation of AES cipher based on (FIPS) 197 
[ http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips197/fips-197.pdf ]

• Designed and Implemented the Advanced Encryption Standard cipher for encryption in SystemVerilog. 

• Successful Functional Verification using Vivado 2015.4.

• Design successfully encrypted test vectors using 128, 192, and 256-bit keys lengths.



# Software Requirements
• Vivado 2014.x (compile SystemVerilog and Verilog code)

• Device settings (see projectSettings.png). Required to perform functional verification.
